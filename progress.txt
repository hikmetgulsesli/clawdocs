# Progress Log
Run: 6445d071-fd22-44a9-bc51-aed307e894e1
Task: ClawDocs - OpenClaw agent documentation system
Started: 2026-02-13

## Codebase Patterns
- Frontend uses React 18 + Vite + TypeScript
- CSS uses CSS variables for theming (--color-*)
- Components are in frontend/src/components/
- Tests use vitest + @testing-library/react (test files excluded from tsconfig for build)
- Build: npm run build (runs tsc && vite build)
- Typecheck: npm run typecheck (tsc --noEmit)
- Test files excluded from tsconfig.json to avoid build conflicts
- Import components without .js extension in test files
