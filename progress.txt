Task: ClawDocs - OpenClaw agent documentation system
Started: 2026-02-13

## Codebase Patterns
- Frontend uses React 18 + Vite + TypeScript
- CSS uses CSS variables for theming (--color-*)
- Components are in frontend/src/components/
- Tests use vitest + @testing-library/react (test files excluded from tsconfig for build)
- Build: npm run build (runs tsc && vite build)
- Typecheck: npm run typecheck (tsc --noEmit)
- Test files excluded from tsconfig.json to avoid build conflicts
- Import components without .js extension in test files

## 2026-02-13 03:33 - US-010: Create agent list page with cards
- Created AgentCard.tsx component with avatar, name, role, model badge, description, skill/tool counts
- Created AgentCard.css with responsive styling and hover effects
- Created AgentsPage.tsx that fetches and displays agents in a grid
- Created AgentsPage.css with responsive grid layout
- Created AgentCard.test.tsx with 13 tests covering all functionality
- Created AgentsPage.test.tsx with 7 tests covering loading, error, empty, and success states
- Added vitest.config.ts with jsdom environment and test setup
- Added test/setup.ts with jest-dom matchers
- Updated package.json with test scripts and vitest dependency
- Updated tsconfig.json to exclude test files from build
- All 20 tests pass
- Typecheck passes
- Build passes
- **Learnings:** Test files need to be excluded from tsconfig.json, use regex matchers for text across multiple elements
